Agriculture is a crucial sector that sustains the global economy, yet it faces persistent challenges from crop diseases that reduce yield and economic stability. This project, "AI-Driven Crop Disease Prediction and Management System," leverages artificial intelligence and machine learning to detect and classify cotton leaf diseases. By utilizing the Cotton Disease Dataset, which consists of images of healthy and diseased cotton leaves, our system applies deep learning techniques, particularly Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), to achieve high-accuracy disease detection. The proposed model enables real-time diagnosis, allowing farmers to take early preventive measures, ultimately reducing losses and improving yield. The system will be implemented as a web and mobile application, offering an intuitive interface where farmers can upload leaf images for instant analysis and receive disease-specific treatment recommendations. Additionally, the platform integrates weather and soil data to enhance predictive accuracy. The solution aims to enhance decision-making, improve food security, and promote sustainable farming practices. By providing cost-effective and scalable disease diagnosis, this AI-powered system significantly contributes to agricultureâ€™s digital transformation, ensuring higher productivity and economic stability for farming communities.
